# k-ledger-ui

k-ledger-ui is a mobile oriented web app that I quickly made to help me use my plain text accounting journal when travelling, with just a mobile device.

Currently it just supports adding an un-verified transaction (might be unbalanced, it's your responsibility to check), but in case I see myself using it I will add some more features, as needed.

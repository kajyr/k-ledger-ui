# kLedger-ui

k-ledger-ui is a mobile oriented web app that I quickly made to help me use my plain text accounting journal when travelling, with just a mobile device.

Currently it just supports adding a simple transaction: it suggests the remaining amount to balance, but it will actually accept an unbalanced transaction.

It suggests also already used accounts and commodities, to make typing from a mobile faster.
